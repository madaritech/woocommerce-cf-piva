Add the "Partita IVA" e "Codice Fiscale" fields in WooCommerce for the italian market. Different labels in the various sections (checkout page, order, etc.) can be configured quickly and easily. In detail:

* a drop-down menu allows the customer to specify the billing type: Receipt Tax or Invoice

* in case the customer selects the invoice, in the checkout a mandatory field is added, in which the customer can specify the VAT or the Tax Code

* in case the customer selects the invoice, the order will specify the choice made and the value of the Tax Code and/or VAT Code

* in the settings page is possible to disable the drop-down menu: in this case the billing type is always Invoice and a mandatory field is added

* by means of a checkbox, from the settings page, the "Company Name" field can be made mandatory if the type of invoice selected is "Invoice"
