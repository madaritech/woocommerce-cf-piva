Add the "Partita IVA" e "Codice Fiscale" fields in WooCommerce for the italian market. Different labels in the various sections (checkout page, order, etc.) can be configured quickly and easily. In detail:

* a drop-down menu allows the customer to specify the billing type: Receipt Tax or Invoice

* in case the customer selects the invoice, in the checkout a mandatory field is added, in which the customer can specify the VAT or the Tax Code

* in case the customer selects the invoice, the order will specify the choice made and the value of the Tax Code and/or VAT Code
